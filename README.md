# An Universal React Movie Carousel app

A totally over-engineered carousel demo retrieving data from external source.

But it has given me the oppertunity to get to know universal/isomorphic javascript, react-router, react-helmet and more.

I've used a starter-kit to get started: [universal react by DominicTobias](https://github.com/DominicTobias/universal-react).
